# Language Bound
A python curses game simlating Storm Bound

## UI Demo
It is colored but I do not want to store a image in this repo
```

## Why Language Bound
It was when @Zarathustra introduced Kongragate's Storm Bound that I started to make a simple python application to simulate it.

It needs *ladder* to access and a lot of work to collect all the cards, making it difficult to play and enjoy.

And... don't you think it cool to have your favorite programing language included as cards and translate the awesome language features into popular card skills?

## Limitations
The UI is currently only designed for termux. And is not friendly to touchpads on both Windows and Ubuntu. (double click on touchpad is a single click on windows, and a single click on touchpad is a double click on Ubuntu.)
